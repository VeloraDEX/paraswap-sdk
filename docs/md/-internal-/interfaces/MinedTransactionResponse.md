# Interface: MinedTransactionResponse

A **MinedTransactionResponse** is an interface representing a
 transaction which has been mined and allows for a type guard for its
 property values being defined.

Returns a new TransactionResponse instance which has the ability to
 detect (and throw an error) if the transaction is replaced, which
 will begin scanning at %%startBlock%%.

 This should generally not be used by developers and is intended
 primarily for internal use. Setting an incorrect %%startBlock%% can
 have devastating performance consequences if used incorrectly.

#### Parameters

Resolves once this transaction has been mined and has
 %%confirms%% blocks including it (default: ``1``) with an
 optional %%timeout%%.

 This can resolve to ``null`` only if %%confirms%% is ``0``
 and the transaction has not been mined, otherwise this will
 wait until enough confirmations have completed.
